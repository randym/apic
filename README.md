# APIc

## What is it?

APIc is a bolt on API console for Rails 3+ applications.
It rounds up your endpoints and makes it dead easy to configure, send, review and replay any request.


![Screen 1](https://github.com/randym/apic/raw/master/sample.png)

What you need to do?

add the gem to your Gemfile

```
gem 'apic'
```

Run the generator!

```
rails generate apic:install
```

If you are using bundler:

```
bundle exec rails generate apic:install

```

Spin up your Rails application and navigate to

```
localhost:3000/apic
```



## Configuration

### Controller Parameters

APIc needs to know about the parameters your PUT, PATCH and UPDATE requests require.
To make this as simple and painless as possible, APIc exposes a DSL to your controllers so you can specify what you need.
APIc knows what type of routes are available and will automatically add in the _method parameter and value for PATCH and DELETE requests.

```
class TestController < ApplicationController

  apic_action_params create: [:name, :acceptance]

  def create
    # all your cool stuff that creates a new object
  end

end
```

Additionally, you can specify custom parameters via the UI so if you dont want to declare your action parameters in your controllers you can always add them from the APIc console.

### Initializer

The apic:install generator will mount APIc to /apic and add in a default intializer providing examples of the route matching and authentication filtering.

```
config/initializers/apic.rb
```

#### Route Matching

APIc will load all routes in your rails app by default under the assumption that you are building your api as a dedicated service.
If this is not the case, you can specify a matching regular expression that APIc will use to find your API routes.

For example, if you have namespecs all of your api endpoints to /api/v1/ simply uncomment out the Apic.routes_matcher line in config/initializers/apic.rb

```
Apic.route_matcher = /\/api\/v1\//
```

#### Custom Headers

When you add headers in APIc we automatically create typeahead options for standard request headers.
However, many, many people define their own headers for use in a custom API. APIc lets you specify
any custom headers you want to make available to the typeahead by setting an array of header names
in the apic.rb initializer.

```
Apic.custom_headers = %w(HTTP-MY-AWESOME-HEADER HTTP-ANTOHER-AWESOME-HEADER)
```

Of course you can create any header you want in the UI, even if it is not defined as a custom header,
but for other people using this tool in your organization or even in public would probably appreciate it if
they didn't have to remember exactly what that header field name was!.

#### Authentication filters

When testing your API it is often convenient to know which routes require authentication as you will need to add those headers before sending your request.
If you specify in your configuration the before_filter you are using for authentication APIc will mark those routes as restricted.

```
Apic.authentication_filter = :authenticate
```

## Requirements

APIc _should_ work on any Rails 3.2+ application out of the box.
If it doesn't, send me a pull request!!

## Roadmap

APIc is still in the very early days. I've gone with greater developer (as in me!) productivity at the cost of more dependencies
in the gem. Moving forward, I'd like to see the following:

- Rebuild views with vanilla erb so I can drop slim-rails
- Find someone who rocks at css/design and ditch bootstrap/sass
- Rewrite the jquery plugins in vanilla js so I can drop jquery and coffee

Under the 'fun' section comes

- Implement OAuth and Basic authentication as well as token caching
- Collect and display response time metrics
- Spec and Doc the crap out of it!

I guess when all that is done, APIc goes to 1.0.0

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.


### Change log

#### 2013.10.08 version 0.0.5
- Removed dependency on bootstrap-sass as it can conflict with repos that use their own bootstrap gem.

#### 2013.10.05 version 0.0.4
- Added support for declaring customized parameters in the APIc console UI.
- Patched bug in action_params collection
- Improved log output to show full request and response details.
- Improved replay to rebuild the headers and endpoint section of the APIc console UI when you click on a history item.

#### 2013.10.05 version 0.0.3
- Removed the default 'api' route matching.
- Rationalized route matching to ensure that internal and apic routes are not exposed as endpoints.
- Altered history links to replay on single click instead of double click.
- added support for customized headers typeahead matching when setting a header.
